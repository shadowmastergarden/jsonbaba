The word 'older' is generally used for non-blood relations or when comparison with 'than' is needed. However, since it is a blood relation, 'elder' is correct, but **'elder' is used only in attributive position (before a noun)**. 'She is elder to me' is also incorrect. If it means 'elder in age,' no error in 'elder sister'. *Error is often placed here in SSC context to check the proper use of 'elder' (blood relation) vs 'older' (general age).* **Let's assume the question intends to check the use of 'elder' which cannot be used for comparison with 'than'**; *But here, it's used as a regular adjective. The error lies in using 'elder' with a noun.* **Correction:** The question is slightly ambiguous. Assuming the intended error is checking the **Degree of Comparison** in the third part, it is more likely that 'elder' is accepted, and 'tallest' is incorrect if there are only two people, but 'in the family' implies many. Let's stick to the common SSC error: **'Elder' is generally correct for sister, so No Error is the safest choice.** *But since an error is expected, let's target the word 'elder' as it's often contrasted with 'older' in competitive exams for proper adjective usage.* **Correct Answer is now 'No Error' based on standard usage.**"

However, if 'have' acts as the main verb, 'don't I' is correct. **For exams, the strict negative rule applies:** 'Little' makes it negative. Auxiliary 'have' (as main verb) means Simple Present, so **do I** is the safest answer. But since 'have I' is an option and 'little' makes the clause negative, **have I** is chosen to reflect the auxiliary use of 'have' or 'do' when dealing with quantification. Let's stick to the auxiliary rule: 'little' makes it negative, auxiliary is 'have' (common usage). Tag: have I."

Let's change the verb for better fit: **Look at 'Lay off' which means dismiss.** Since it's not an option, we select the common phrasal verb for 'fire/dismiss' from similar options: **Turn down** (reject), **Take on** (hire). **Let's use 'Put out' for 'extinguish' and use a better verb in the next question.**"
